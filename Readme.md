User types into the search input.

2️⃣ Debounced fetch

The app waits 450ms before sending the request (prevents spam).

3️⃣ Real-time API Request

Uses fetch() to retrieve:

temperature, humidity, wind, feels_like, icon, coordinates

4️⃣ UI Updates

Clean weather card updates instantly with animations.

5️⃣ Save Preset

Click Save Preset to store the last city permanently in browser storage.
